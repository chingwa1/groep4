							<div><p>THE RAISER OF THE ORCHESTRA</p><br>

									<p>
									Born in Dordrecht, The Netherlands. In 1856, Willem Kes had already established a successful musical career as violinist and conductor. He was appointed as conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1888. He also became the first chief conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Within a short period of time, he was able to create a good ensemble, earning himself considerable praise. Willem Kes was also very strict and demanded a lot of discipline from his musicians. Those who came late to rehearsal got fined. And the musicians who played poorly had to remain behind in the boardroom to practise their parts. He also demanded silence from the audience during performances, something unusual in those days. Under his leadership the Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam grew into international fame. When Kes left the orchestra in 1895 (to conduct in Glasgow), his replacement, Willem Mengelberg, inherited an orchestra ready for the big move onto the international stage.

									Willem Kes distinguished himself through great musicality combined with the gift of common sense, which prevented him from lapsing into overly-sentimental Romantic interpretations. These were the years when both the young orchestra and its Amsterdam audience still needed to be ‘brought up’  to fit into modern orchestral practice. The result, however, was well worth the effort. When Kes left the orchestra in 1895 (to conduct in Glasgow), his replacement, Willem Mengelberg, inherited an orchestra ready for the big move onto the international stage.

							<h2><span>Willem Mengelberg</span> 1895 - 1930</h2>
							<div><p>CHIEF CONDUCTOR</p><br>

									<p>1895 - 1930
									At the age of 24, Willem Mengelberg succeeded Kes as principal conductor in 1895. During the fifty years that he held the baton in front of the Concertgebouw Orchestra, strong bonds were formed with a wide variety of composers such as Richard Strauss, Mahler, Ravel, Debussy, Stravinksy, Schönberg, Schreker and Milhaud, all of whom conducted the Concertgebouw Orchestra more than once. (these composers also actually visited the concerts Mengelberg gave). Mahler was also a good friend of Willem Mengelberg.

									1930 - 1945 
									The Royal Orchestra also felt the crisis in the 1930s. There weren’t many visitors anymore so Willem Mengelberg had to come up with other ideas to gain visitors. In 1934 the Orchestra played at the Olympic games.
									Willem Mengelberg was forced to take his leave from the orchestra when he was dismissed in 1945 owing to his compliant attitude during the war years.
									He was convinced that music had nothing to do with politics so he let himself get exploited by the nazi for propeganda purposes. The music of Mahler was baned from the repotoire by the Nazi’s.
									After that Mengelberg went to the Swiss Alpes. By the time the public opinion of the Dutch about him ch

									<h2><span>Eduard van Beinum</span> 1945 - 1959</h2>

									<div><p>Eduard van Beinum Second conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra since 1931, took over from Mengelberg as Chief Conductor in 1945. During the post-war years he developed into a conductor much loved by both the public and the orchestra.</p>
									<br>
									<p>The changes that took place in society at that time also made their mark on the profession of conductor. From the traditional position of ‘maestro’, the position of principal conductor evolved into one of ‘musician among musicians’. And this certainly suited van Beinum’s character. Under his leadership, the orchestra developed an affinity with the French repetoire and Bruckner gained a permanent position on the stage in Amsterdam.Van Beinum died unexpectedly during a rehearsal in April 1959. He was succeeded by the young Bernard Haitink.

							<h2><span>Bernard Haitink</span> 1963 - 1988</h2>
									<div><p>Starting from 1963, Haitink was chief conductor for 25 years, during which time the orchestra developed significantly. Particularly Haitink’s interpretations of Mahler and Bruckner made a worldwide impression. In addition, he and the orchestra built up a broad repertoire from classical to contemporary works, many of which were recorded. He also led the orchestra on many international tours.

							<h2><span>Ricardo Chailly</span> 1988 - 2004</h2>
									<div><p>Riccardo Chailly was the chief conductor of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra from 1988 to 2004. He considerably broadened the repertoire of the orchestra. While he was able to continue the tradition of the great romantic works in a new way, at the same time he expanded the orchestra’s repertoire of contemporary music and opera.</p><br>
									<p>He conducted the orchestra during tours to the most important European festivals as well as to Japan, Korea, China, and North and South America. Together with the orchestra he recorded numerous CDs with an exceptionally broad repertoire, several of which received multiple awards. On his departure he was appointed as conductor emeritus. He returned for several concerts with the Concertgebouw Orchestra in April 2013.

							<h2><span>Mariss Jansons</span> 2004 - 2015</h2>
									<div><p>Mariss is the first to have a international reputation prior to resuming the post. What is Mariss Jansons’s secret? How does he consistently manage to take his orchestras to a higher level and garner international recognition? In the December 2008 issue of Gramophone, he described his approach as follows: ‘It’s my task to find out the orchestra’s special qualities and preserve them. Then, if through a natural process my own individuality adds something – and theirs to me – that will be fine.’ And fine it most certainly is, a fact that became readily apparent after his appointment as chief conductor of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra back in 2004.
									Since making his first guest appearance with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra on 28 October 1988, he returned nearly every year thereafter and was appointed its chief conductor in 2004. He is the sixth conductor to hold the post since the orchestra was founded in 1888

							<h2><span>Daniele Gatti</span> 2015 - Now</h2>
									<div><p>Daniele Gatti gave an astounding first performance as guest conductor with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in 2004 with works by Richard Strauss and Wagner. He has since been invited very regularly to return. Maestro Gatti's concert performances are characterised by highly individual interpretations of the traditional orchestral repertoire and a fondness for less common works. Daniele Gatti has made several tours abroad with the orchestra. In 2013 he conducted Mahler's Symphony No. 9 on several important European festivals. A CD featuring works by Berg performed by the RCO and Maestro Gatti has been released on the orchestra's in-house label, RCO Live. He last appeared with the orchestra conducting Verdi’s Falstaff in a June 2014 production at the Dutch National Opera, garnering both public and critical acclaim.
